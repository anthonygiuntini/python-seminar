# Week 2 Notes

Unfortunately, I forgot to record the second session. The main topic of that session was `while` loops. Which are blocks of code that repeat while a condition is true. 

If you missed that class, take a look at the class code in this folder.

Also, here's an online tutorial covering `while` loops. Check it out:
