# Guessing game exercise
# Program a game that picks a random number and asks the user to guess it
# it should guide the user by indicating if the number was too high or too low
# until the user gets the number right, or the number of guesses has run out

# while loops, if statements, libraries

#what you will need
import random # import the random library -> for dealing with random numbers

random.randint(1,10) # returns a random number between 1 and 10
